# 15 days of Vanilla JS
## Day 04 - Navbar Toggle

## Toggle a page links
When the window is small sized, you can't see Home, About or Other Navigation buttons,instead you will see a little ham burger like button at the top right.

If you click that button, nav links will toggle on and off. 
This functionality is done using the javascript to change the style of the nav links.

<b>You must try it reducing the browser window size!</b>
